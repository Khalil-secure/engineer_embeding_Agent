# 🤖 Engineer Embedding Agent

**Engineer Embedding Agent** is an AI-powered assistant designed to act as an **embedding engineer**. Its mission is to understand a user's technical needs—expressed through natural conversation or text—and translate them into:

- ✅ Functional Raspberry Pi code
- 🛒 A shopping list of required hardware components

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Understand user intent** through conversation or text prompts.
- **Translate needs into embedded system logic** (e.g., GPIO control, sensor integration).
- **Generate Python code** for Raspberry Pi that fulfills the user's request.
- **Identify and list hardware components** needed for the project.
- **Provide shopping links or commands** to acquire the components.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Conversational Input**  
   The user describes their idea or problem (e.g., “I want to build a motion-activated light system”).

2. **Intent Extraction**  
   The agent uses NLP to extract:
   - Functional requirements
   - Sensor/actuator types
   - Control logic

3. **Code Generation**  
   Based on the extracted intent, the agent generates:
   - Python code for Raspberry Pi
   - GPIO pin mappings
   - Sensor/actuator setup

4. **Component Mapping**  
   The agent identifies:
   - Required components (e.g., PIR sensor, LEDs, resistors)
   - Quantities and specifications
   - Shopping list with links or terminal commands

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenAI / LLMs** for intent understanding
- **Raspberry Pi GPIO libraries**
- **LangChain / Agentic frameworks** (planned)
- **Web scraping / APIs** for component sourcing

## 📦 Example Use Case

> **User**: “I want to build a temperature monitor that sends an alert if it gets too hot.”

> **Agent Output**:
- Python code using `Adafruit_DHT` and `smtplib`
- Shopping list:
  - DHT22 sensor
  - Raspberry Pi 4
  - Jumper wires
- Email alert setup instructions
